# Output example: 0xabcd1234...
# Save this as RELAYER_PRIVATE_KEY
```

**Derive Public Address:**
```bash
# Using ethers.js
node -e "const ethers = require('ethers'); const wallet = new ethers.Wallet('YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY'); console.log(wallet.address);"

# Save as RELAYER_ADDRESS
```

---

### Step 3: Fund Relayer (5 min)

1. Go to https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/base-sepolia
2. Enter your `RELAYER_ADDRESS`
3. Request 0.1 ETH
4. Verify on https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/YOUR_ADDRESS

---

### Step 4: Deploy Contracts (10 min)

```bash
# 1. Deploy Governance Contract
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-base.ts --network baseSepolia

# Output: Contract deployed to: 0x123...
# Save as NEXT_PUBLIC_GOVERNANCE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS

# 2. Deploy Zap Contract
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-zap-gasless.ts --network baseSepolia

# Output: Contract deployed to: 0x456...
# Save as NEXT_PUBLIC_ZAP_GASLESS_CONTRACT_ADDRESS

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Unknown Network"
**Solution:** Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID`

### Issue: "Relayer out of funds"
**Solution:** Fund relayer wallet with more ETH

### Issue: "Contract not found"
**Solution:** Verify contract addresses are correct

### Issue: "Signature verification failed"
**Solution:** Check chainId matches (84532 for Base Sepolia)

---

curl "https://sepolia.base.org" \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBalance","params":["YOUR_RELAYER_ADDRESS","latest"],"id":1}'
```

### Check Transaction Status
```bash
# Visit
https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/YOUR_RELAYER_ADDRESS
```
